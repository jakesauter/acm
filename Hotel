first input is the amount of people (size of the array)
the second input is the top floor of the hotel (helps with sorting)
make an array of a class person, that has the time that you have to be there, and what floor they are on
sort that array by highest floor to lowst floor
keep a global timeElapsed variable
make sure to add one when going down floor
make sure to wait while you are the the floor
